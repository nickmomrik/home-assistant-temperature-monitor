# Home Assistant - Temperature & Humidity Sensors
My goal with this project was to create a device I could leave in the garage, which would push temperature and humidity data to Home Assistant. I also wanted to be able to enable a "monitor" mode when I turn on the heat in the garage so the system would alert me when a certain temperature was reached.
